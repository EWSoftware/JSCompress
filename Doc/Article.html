<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article presents a JavaScript compression tool that takes your
JavaScript source code and compresses it by removing all comments,
extraneous whitespace, and optionally as many line feeds as possible, and
by optionally shortening function parameter and variable names. This will
reduce the script size and may help your pages load faster and reduce
bandwidth. A minor side benefit when line feed removal and variable
name compression is enabled is that it provides lightweight obfuscation of
the code making it harder for the casual user to read and/or play around with
it. It won't stop a determined user from reformatting and reverse
engineering it, but that is not the intent of this tool.</p>

<p>I developed this tool for use in my own ASP.NET projects. The code is
written in C# but as long as you have the .NET Framework installed, it can
be used to compress JavaScript for any web project, .NET or otherwise.  The
supplied project file is for Visual Studio 2003 but it can be opened,
converted, and successfully compiled under Visual Studio 2005 as well.</p>

<p>There are three levels of compression:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>No Line Feed Removal</b>
<p>Line feeds are not removed from the script (except those deemed
extraneous such as on blank lines). Only comments and extraneous whitespace
is removed. This mode provides good compression and insures that no code is
broken.</p></li>

<li><b>Line Feeds Removed Wherever Possible</b>
<p>In this mode, line feeds are removed from the ends of statements in
which it is determined safe to do so, usually resulting in an extra 2% to
5% compression. For example, lines ending in an operator such as <code
lang=javascript>*</code>, <code lang=javascript>/</code>, <code
lang=javascript>+</code>, <code lang=javascript>-</code>, etc. and those
ending in a semi-colon will have any trailing line feeds removed. There are
several other conditions that can be met resulting in removal, and those
are described below in the code description sections. Steps are also taken
to prevent removal in instances such as missing semi-colons so as not to
break code. However, I may not have caught all such conditions so if code
is broken by this mode, you can fall back to the above mode. This mode
achieves its best results when you are diligent about putting semi-colons
after all statements that can use them to properly mark their
endpoints.</p></li>

<li><b>Function Parameter and Variable Name Compression</b>
<p>This can be combined with one of the first two compression options to
further reduce the script size.  When enabled, as many function parameter
and variable names as possible will be renamed and shortened.  The naming
scheme starts with the names <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>, then
<code>_a</code> through <code>_z</code>, <code>_aa</code> through
<code>_az</code>, <code>_ba</code> through <code>_bz</code>, etc.  With
this option enabled, script size can usually be reduced by an additional
10% to 15%. There may be a higher potential for broken code with this
option so it is not enabled by default. If enabled, it is recommended that
you thoroughly test all compressed scripts before deploying them.</p></li></ul>

<p>Code blocks can also be surrounded by special <code>// #pragma
NoCompStart</code> and <code>// #pragma NoCompEnd</code> comments to
exclude sections from compression. This is useful for including copyright
notices in the header of compressed script files or skipping sections that
you are testing. For example:</p>

<pre lang=jscript>
// #pragma NoCompStart
//====================================================
// File    : TestScript1.js
// Author  : Eric Woodruff
// Updated : 07/23/2003
// #pragma NoCompEnd

// Anything from this point forward will be compressed
// .
// .
// .

// #pragma NoCompStart

// Skip compression on this section
function Test()
{
    return true;
}

// #pragma NoCompEnd

// Resume compression
// .
// .
// .
</pre>

<p>The <code>#pragma</code> comments should appear on lines by themselves
and will be removed from the final compressed script. Any trailing comment
text on the same line as the <code>#pragma</code> is ignored and will be
removed as well. The compressor doesn't care about spacing or case on the
<code>#pragma</code> statements either.</p>

<h2>The Programs</h2>
<p>Two versions of the program are provided. The first is an interactive
version that you can use to test the different modes of compression. It is
a Windows Forms application written in C#. After running it, simply paste
your JavaScript code into the <i>Original Script</i> text box, turn the
<i>Line Feed Removal</i> and <i>Variable Name Compression</i> options on or
off, and click the <i>Compress</i> button. The compressed script is then
shown in the <i>Compressed Script</i> textbox with some compression
statistics displayed below it. The text can be copied to the clipboard from
the <i>Compressed Script</i> text box.</p>

<p>Note that when using the <i>Test only variable name compression</i>
option, the script code is not compressed.  Only parameter and variable
names are compressed.  This may help locate a problem with the variable
name compression code.  Although the script code is not compressed,
comments are removed so that the naming results match (i.e. it won't use
different names due to matching a word that appears in a comment such as
"a", "be", or "to").

<p>The second and most useful tool is a console mode version of the
compressor that can be used as the command for a pre-build step in ASP.NET
projects to compress scripts in the project. It can also be used to
compress scripts that are stored in custom web controls as embedded
resources. The command line syntax is shown below. Options and file specs
are case-insensitive and are processed from left to right as
encountered.</p><pre lang=text>JSCompressCL [/options] filespec [[/options]
filespec ...]</pre>

<p>The available command line options are as follows:</p>

<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="5" width="80%" border="1">
<tr>
<td style="BACKGROUND: #bfbfbf"><b>Option</b></td>
<td style="BACKGROUND: #bfbfbf"><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/?</td>
<td>Show help</td>
<tr>
<td>/q</td>
<td>Quiet mode. Don't display compression statistics.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/debug</td>
<td>Debug build, compression is suppressed and scripts are passed through
to the output folder unmodified to make debugging easier. Compression can
be forced using the /f option.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/release</td>
<td>Release build, compression enabled (the default if no build option is
specified).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/k</td>
<td>(Keep) No line feeds are removed unless they are extraneous (i.e. blank
lines).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/d</td>
<td>(Delete) Line feeds are removed wherever possible (the default if no
line feed removal option is specified).</td></tr>
<td>/v</td>
<td>Compress variable and parameter names.</td></tr>
<td>/t</td>
<td>Variable name compression only (for testing it).  This will strip
comments as well but all other compression options are ignored.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/f</td>
<td>Force compression on processed files in debug builds. Useful for
testing compressed scripts in debug builds.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/r</td>
<td>Recurse sub-folders in the filespec too.  The sub-folder structure will
be duplicated in the output folder.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/o:&lt;dir&gt;</td>
<td>Specify output folder (current folder if not specified).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>filespec</td>
<td>One or more files to compress, wildcards accepted.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The debug and release build options are spelled out to make it easy to
specify them in a project's pre-build step using one of the IDE macros.
This is described below.</p>

<p>At the minimum, you should specify an output folder other than the one
in which the scripts to compress reside. For example, you may want to store
the uncompressed scripts in a folder called <i>ScriptsDev</i> and tell the
compressor to store the compressed scripts in a folder called
<i>Scripts</i> that the application will use at runtime. The compressor
will not overwrite the source scripts. On debug builds, it also checks for
an existing copy of the script and, if the timestamp is greater than or
equal to the source script, it skips it. This saves recreating a script
file that has not changed each time the project is built during debugging.
An "up to date" message is displayed in such cases. The scripts are always
processed in release builds to ensure that they are up to date and are
compressed.</p>

<p>If a script is compressed, the tool displays the source and destination
filenames along with compression statistics. The <code>/q</code> command line
option can be used to turn them off. Some examples are shown below (lines
wrapped for display purposes):</p>

<pre lang=text>
Implied release build with line feed removal,
no stats displayed.

    JSCompressCL /q /o:\MyProj\Scripts
        \MyProj\ScriptsDev\*.js

Explicit release build with line feed removal,
stats are displayed.

    JSCompressCL /release /o:\MyProj\Scripts
        \MyProj\ScriptsDev\*.js

Line feed removal disabled for first file set, line feed
removal and variable name compression enabled for second file set.

    JSCompressCL /o:\MyProj\Scripts
        /k \MyProj\ScriptsDev1\*.js
        /d /v \MyProj\ScriptsDev2\*.js

Debug build, no compression.  Scripts are passed
through unmodified for debugging purposes.

    JSCompressCL /Debug /o:\MyProj\Scripts
        \MyProj\ScriptsDev\*.js

Debug build with forced compression.  Scripts are
compressed even though it's a debug build.

    JSCompressCL /Debug /f /o:\MyProj\Scripts
        \MyProj\ScriptsDev\*.js</pre>

<h2>Using the Console Version as a Project's Pre-Build Step</h2>
<p>Copy the console version of the application to a folder somewhere on
your PC. To use the console version as the pre-build step of a web project,
create one folder to contain the uncompressed scripts (<i>ScriptDev</i> for
example) and another to contain the compressed scripts to be used at
runtime by the application (<i>Scripts</i> for example). To create a new
folder in the project, right click on the project name, select
<i>Add...</i>, select <i>New Folder</i>, and enter the folder name. Add a
new script to the folder by right clicking on it and selecting
<i>Add...</i> and then <i>Add New Item...</i> to create a new item or
<i>Add Existing Item...</i> if you copied an existing file to the new
folder. Once added to the project folder, right click on the script and
select <i>Properties</i>. Change the <i>Build Action</i> property from
<i>Content</i> to <i>None</i> for the scripts in the development
(uncompressed) folder. You can add copies of the scripts in the compressed
folder and leave their build action set to <i><b>Content</b></i> if you
want to do so.</p>

<p>The next step is to right click on the project name, select
<i>Properties</i>, expand the <i>Common Properties</i> folder, and select
the <i>Build Events</i> sub-item. Click in the <i>Pre-build Event Command
Line</i> option to enter the command line to run. You can click the
<b>"..."</b> button to open a dialog with a larger editor and a list of
available macros. Below is an example of a common command line that can be
used (lines wrapped for display purposes). Replace the path to the tool
with the path where you stored it on your PC.</p>

<pre lang=text>
D:\Utils\JSCompressCL /$(ConfigurationName)
    /o:$(ProjectDir)Scripts $(ProjectDir)ScriptsDev\*.js
</pre>

<p>The <code>/$(ConfigurationName)</code> option expands to the
configuration name in effect at the time of the build. Assuming the
defaults, this will equate to either <i>/Debug</i> or <i>/Release</i> thus
turning off compression for debug builds so that you can test your scripts
and debug them and turn it on for release builds. Note that the command
line processor will look for an entry starting with "Debug" or "Release" so
you can use custom configuration names. As long as they start with either
of those two keywords, it will select the appropriate build type. If the
configuration name contains spaces, place quote marks around the option. As
noted, in debug builds scripts are passed through to the destination folder
as-is to make debugging easier. If you want the scripts compressed in debug
builds, add the <code>/f</code> command line option to force compression to
be used.</p>

<p>The <code>/o:$(ProjectDir)Scripts</code> option equates to the
compressed script folder. For my projects, it is always a subfolder of the
main project folder, thus the use of the <code>$(ProjectDir)</code> macro.
Modify the path name accordingly for your own projects.</p>

<p>The same applies for the <code>$(ProjectDir)ScriptsDev\*.js</code>
option which tells the tool where to find the scripts that need to be
compressed. As above, modify the path name accordingly for your own
projects.</p>

<h3>Compressing Scripts That are Embedded Resources</h3>
<p>If you are developing a web control, for example, that uses scripts that
are contained in the assembly as embedded resources, you can still compress
them using the above steps. The only difference is that when setting up the
folders as described above, make an initial copy of the scripts and place
them in the compressed script folder. In the project manager, right click
on the scripts in the compressed script folder, select <i>Properties</i>
and change the <i>Build Action</i> property to <i>Embedded Resource</i>.
When you build the project, the pre-build command will compress the
scripts, the project will then be built in the normal fashion, and the
compressed scripts will be embedded as resources in the assembly.</p>

<h2>How the Code Works</h2>
<p>The code for the Windows Forms and the console applications is fairly
straightforward and there is nothing much to describe. The forms version
takes data from the controls and uses it with the <code>JSCompressor</code>
class. The console mode version does the same thing but using command line
parameters. The class itself is where the action occurs and is described
below. The code for the class can be found in the <i>JSCompressor.cs</i>
file.</p>

<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<p>The <code>JSCompressor</code> class is fairly simple and consists of a
couple of constructors, properties to modify the line feed removal mode and
variable name compression settings, a public method to compress scripts, and
several private data members and methods. The default constructor enables
line feed removal by default. A second version of the constructor takes a
Boolean parameter that lets you specify the initial state for line feed
removal (<code lang=cs>true</code> for enabled, <code lang=cs>false</code>
for disabled). The <code>LineFeedRemoval</code> property lets you modify
the mode after construction.  The third constructor takes two Boolean
parameters that let you specify the initial state for the line feed
removal and variable name compression options.  The
<code>CompressVariableNames</code> property can be used to modify the
variable name compression setting after construction.  Variable name
compression is off by default.  In addition, the
<code>TestVariableNameCompression</code> property can be set to true to
test the variable name compression code.  When set to true, script
compression is disabled and only parameter and variable names are
compressed.  As noted above, comments are removed though so that you end up
with an identical set of renamed variables and parameters.</p>

<h3>The Compression Process</h3>
<p>The <code>Compress</code> method of the <code>JSCompressor</code> class
does all of the work. It is passed a copy of the uncompressed script and
returns the compressed version.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Compress the specified JavaScript code.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="strScript"&gt;The script to compress&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;The compressed script&lt;/returns&gt;
public string Compress(string strScript)
{
    string strCompressed;
    char [] achScriptChars;

    // Don't bother if there is nothing to compress
    if(strScript == null || strScript.Length == 0)
        return strScript;

    // Set up for compression
    scLiterals.Clear();
    scNoComps.Clear();

    // Create the regular expressions and match evaluators on
    // first use.
    if(reInsLit == null)
    {
        reExtNoComp = new Regex(@"//\s*#pragma\s*NoCompStart.*?" +
            @"//\s*#pragma\s*NoCompEnd.*?\n",
            RegexOptions.Multiline | RegexOptions.Singleline |
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
        reDelNoComp = new Regex(@"//\s*#pragma\s*NoComp(Start|End).*\n",
            RegexOptions.Multiline | RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
        reInsLit = new Regex("\xFE|\xFF");
        meInsLit = new MatchEvaluator(OnMarkerFound);
        meExtNoComp = new MatchEvaluator(OnNoCompFound);

        reFuncParams = new Regex(@"function.*?\((.*?)\)(.*?|\n)?\{",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Singleline);
        reFindVars = new Regex(@"(var\s+.*?)(;|$)",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Multiline);
        reStripVarPrefix = new Regex(@"^var\s+",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
        reStripParens = new Regex(@"\(.*?,.*?\)|\[.*?,.*?\]",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
        reStripAssign = new Regex(@"(=.*?)(,|;|$)",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
    }
</pre>

<p>The first part initializes two string collections that will end up
containing any "no compression" sections specified by the
<code>#pragma</code> comments and any literal strings found during parsing.
A set of regular expressions and match evaluators are also initialized to
help with the parsing and compression process. Their use is described
later.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Extract sections that the user doesn't want compressed
// and replace them with a marker.
strCompressed = reExtNoComp.Replace(strScript, meExtNoComp);

// This is the match evaluator referenced by meExtNoComp:

// Extract the sections that the user doesn't want compressed
// and save them for reinsertion at the end without the #pragmas.
// They are replaced with a marker character.
private string OnNoCompFound(Match match)
{
    scNoComps.Add(reDelNoComp.Replace(match.Value, String.Empty));
    return "\xFE";
}
</pre>

<p>The next part extracts the sections, if any, that the user does not want
compressed as specified via the <code>#pragma</code> comments (i.e.
copyright notices at the top of the file). To do this, a match evaluator is
used that adds the found section to the string collection and replaces it
in the script with a marker character (<code>\xFE</code>). The marker will
be replaced with the uncompressed section at the end of the process.
Replacing the section with a marker helps the remainder of the code to
remove extraneous whitespace by giving it less to look at. The
<code>#pragma</code> comments are stripped from the sections before storing
them in the collection.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Split the string into an array for parsing
achScriptChars = strCompressed.ToCharArray();

// Remove comments and extract literals
CompressArray(achScriptChars);
</pre>

<p>After the "no compression" sections have been removed, the script is
split into a character array to make parsing simpler. The array is passed
to the <code>CompressArray</code> method which scans the script one
character at a time looking for block comments, line comments, literal
strings, and JavaScript regular expressions enclosed in slashes (/ /).
Block comments and line comments are removed by setting all characters
within the comments to a null in the array. However, sections between
<code>/*@</code> and <code>@*/</code> are left in the code as they indicate
a conditional compilation section.  The code between the conditional
section markers will still be compressed.  Note that if you do use
conditional compilation comments, it is important to end the line preceding
the block with a semi-colon as the browser will not process the conditional
block unless it starts on a distinct line.</p>

<p>Literal strings and regular expressions are extracted and stored in a
string collection and are replaced by a marker character
(<code>\xFF</code>) using a method similar to extracting and storing the
"no compression" sections. Again, this helps the final steps remove
extraneous whitespace by giving it less to look at. During this process,
carriage returns are converted to line feeds which makes it easy to remove
them later on as well.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Gather up what's left and remove the nulls
strCompressed = new String(achScriptChars);
strCompressed = strCompressed.Replace("\0", String.Empty);

// Skip code compression?
if(!varCompTest)
{
    // Remove all leading and trailing whitespace and condense runs
    // of two or more whitespace characters to just one.
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"^[\s]+|[ \f\r\t\v]+$",
        String.Empty, RegexOptions.Multiline);
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"([\s]){2,}", "$1");
</pre>

<p>Once the array has been parsed, it is converted back into a string and
all null characters (representing removed sections) are deleted. After
that, regular expressions are used to remove leading and trailing
whitespace from all lines and to condense all runs of two or more
whitespace characters to just one.  This part and the subsequent steps are
skipped if only testing variable name compression.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Line feed removal requested?
if(removeLineFeeds)
{
    // Remove line feeds when they appear near numbers with signs
    // or operators.  A space is used between + and - occurrences
    // in case they are increment/decrement operators followed by
    // an add/subtract operation.  In other cases, line feeds are
    // only removed following a + or - if it is not part of an
    // increment or decrement operation.
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"([+-])\n\1",
        "$1 $1");
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"([^+-][+-])\n",
        "$1");
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
        @"([\xFE{}([,&lt;&gt;/*%&amp;|^!~?:=.;])\n", "$1");
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
        @"\n([{}()[\],&lt;&gt;/*%&amp;|^!~?:=.;+-])" ,"$1");
}
</pre>

<p>The next step is to see if line feed removal has been requested. If so,
all line feeds occurring near numbers with signs and near operators are
removed. As noted in the comments, care is taken around the <code
lang=javascript>+</code> and <code lang=javascript>-</code> characters so
that whitespace and line feeds are left around increment and decrement
operations (<code lang=javascript>++</code> and <code
lang=javascript>--</code>) where needed to prevent breaking code.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Strip all unnecessary whitespace around operators
strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
    @"[ \f\r\t\v]?([\n\xFE\xFF/{}()[\];,&lt;&gt;*%&amp;|^!~?:=])[ \f\r\t\v]?",
    "$1");
strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"([^+]) ?(\+)",
    "$1$2");
strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"(\+) ?([^+])",
    "$1$2");
strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"([^-]) ?(\-)",
    "$1$2");
strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed, @"(\-) ?([^-])",
    "$1$2");
</pre>

<p>A final set of regular expressions is used to strip whitespace from
around operators and the marker characters. Again, special care is taken
with the <code lang=javascript>+</code> and <code lang=javascript>-</code>
operators so as to correctly strip whitespace around occurrences of
increment and decrement operations.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
// Try for some additional line feed removal savings by
// stripping them out from around one-line if, while,
// and for statements and cases where any of those
// statements immediately follow another.
if(removeLineFeeds)
{
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
        @"(\W(if|while|for)\([^{]*?\))\n", "$1");
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
        @"(\W(if|while|for)\([^{]*?\))((if|while|for)\([^{]*?\))\n",
        "$1$3");
    strCompressed = Regex.Replace(strCompressed,
        @"([;}]else)\n", "$1 ");
}
</pre>

<p>After removing all extraneous whitespace, if line feed removal has been
requested, a few additional steps are taken to remove unnecessary line
feeds from around <code lang=javascript>if</code>, <code
lang=javascript>while</code>, and <code lang=javascript>for</code>
statements. This helps remove line feeds from instances where those
statements occur one after the other in any combination with no intervening
brace character. For example, the following would get condensed to a single
line:</p>

<pre lang=jscript>
    if(a == 1)
        for(b = 0; b &lt; 10; b++)
            while(!c)
                c = DoSomething();
</pre>

<p>If the code contains semi-colons on all statements that need them to
mark their endpoints, the above process can usually remove all line feeds
from the script reducing it to one long stream of characters thus providing
maximum code compression.</p>

<pre lang=cs>
    // Compress variable names too if requested
    if(compressVarNames || varCompTest)
        strCompressed = CompressVariables(strCompressed);

    // Put back the literals and uncompressed sections removed
    // during the parsing step.
    noCompCount = literalCount = 0;
    strCompressed = reInsLit.Replace(strCompressed, meInsLit);

    return strCompressed;
}

// This is the match evaluator referenced by meInsLit:

// Replace a literal or uncompressed section marker with the
// next entry from the appropriate collection.
private string OnMarkerFound(Match match)
{
    if(match.Value == "\xFE")
        return scNoComps[noCompCount++];

    return scLiterals[literalCount++];
}
</pre>

<p>Variable name compression occurs next if requested.  This process will
be described in the next section.  The last step is to reinsert the
uncompressed sections and literal strings. In a manner similar to
extraction, a regular expression and a match evaluator are used. Two
private counters are used to keep track of the progress through the string
collections. As each marker character is found, the match evaluator is
called and, depending on the marker found, it returns the next element from
the appropriate collection which then takes the place of the marker. The
matching counter is also incremented ready for the next match. After the

<h3>Parameter and Variable Name Compression</h3>
The <code>CompressVariables</code> method handles the compression of
function parameter and variable names.  Since there is the potential to
break code, the compression method takes a conservative approach to
locating and renaming variables.

<ul>
<li>Function parameter names appearing within the parentheses on a function
declaration are included for compression.</li>
<li>Variable names on the same line as a <code>var</code> statement are
included for compression.  However, if the <code>var</code> statement spans
lines and extra line feed removal is disabled, some names may be missed.  For
example:</li>

<pre lang="jscript">
var string1, string2,
    num1, num2;
</pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>string1</code> and <code>string2</code> will
always be included but <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> will not be
included if the <code>LineFeedRemoval</code> property is set to false as
they will always appear on a line by themselves with no indication that
they are variables.</p>

<li>On a similar note, variable names that appear in the code but that are
not formally declared with a <code>var</code> statement will always be
ignored (i.e. global variables declared in another module).</li>

<li>If you declare global variables that are referenced in other script
files, you should wrap their declarations in a
<code>#pragma NoCompStart/NoCompEnd</code> section so that they are not
renamed within the file that they are declared.</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual renaming process occurs as follows:</p>

<pre lang="cs">
private string CompressVariables(string script)
{
    StringCollection scVariables = new StringCollection();
    string[] varNames;
    string name = null, matchName;
    bool incVarName;

    // Find function parameters
    MatchCollection matches = reFuncParams.Matches(script);

    foreach(Match m in matches)
    {
        varNames = m.Groups[1].Value.Split(',');

        // Add each unique name to the list
        foreach(string s in varNames)
        {
            name = s.Trim();

            if(name.Length != 0 && !scVariables.Contains(name))
                scVariables.Add(name);
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>The first part searches for function parameters using a regular expression
created earlier.  The parameter list is split apart and each unique
parameter name is added to the variable name string collection.</p>

<pre lang="cs">
// Find variable declarations
matches = reFindVars.Matches(script);

foreach(Match m in matches)
{
    // Remove the "var " declaration prefix
    name = reStripVarPrefix.Replace(m.Groups[1].Value, String.Empty);

    // Strip brackets and parentheses containing commas such
    // as array declarations and method calls with parameters.
    name = reStripParens.Replace(name, String.Empty);

    // Remove assignment operations
    name = reStripAssign.Replace(name, "$2");

    varNames = name.Split(',');

    // Add each unique name to the list
    foreach(string s in varNames)
    {
        name = s.Trim();

        if(name.Length != 0 && !scVariables.Contains(name))
            scVariables.Add(name);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The next part searches for <code>var</code> statements that contain variable
name declarations using a regular expression created earlier.  This step is
slightly more complex as it must account for assignments that occur within
the statement as well as possible references to array indices that might
cause an incorrect split to occur.  For example:</p>

<pre lang="jscript">
var num1, string1 = "Test", num2 = array1[3, 0];
var resultString = functionCall("A", "B");
</pre>

<p>The <code>var</code> prefix is removed from the statement followed by any
parts of the expressions that contain brackets or parentheses containing
commas (i.e. two-dimensional array indices, function call parameters, etc.
as shown in the above examples).  Once they are removed, a final regular
expression is used to remove any remaining assignment text from the equal
sign to the next comma or end of the line.  Once this is done, it is safe
to split the string on each comma and add the unique names to the variable
name string collection.</p>

<pre lang="cs">
// Replace each variable in the list with a shorter name.
// Start with "a" through "z" then use "_a" through "_z",
// "_aa" to "_az", "_ba" to "_bz", etc.
newVarName = new char[10];
newVarName[0] = '\x60';
varNamePos = 0;
incVarName = true;

foreach(string replaceName in scVariables)
{
    // Increment the variable name and make sure it isn't
    // in use already.
    if(incVarName)
    {
        do
        {
            IncrementVariableName();

            name = new String(newVarName, 0, varNamePos + 1);
            matchName = @"\W" + name + @"\W";

        } while(Regex.IsMatch(script, matchName));

        incVarName = false;
    }

    // Don't bother if the existing name is shorter.  This check
    // could be removed to obfuscate the variable name even if it
    // would be longer.
    if(name.Length < replaceName.Length)
    {
        incVarName = true;
        script = Regex.Replace(script,
            @"(\W)" + replaceName + @"(?=\W)", "$1" + name);
    }
}

return script;
</pre>

<p>The final step loops through each unique variable name found and
substitutes a shorter name.  Once done, the compressed script is returned.
As noted in the comments, the naming scheme starts with <code>a</code>
through <code>z</code> and, if they run out, it adds an underscore prefix
and carries on (<code>_a</code> through <code>_z</code>).  The underscore
ensures that it will not accidentally create a name that could match a
keyword once it gets past single letter variable names.  Should those names
be exhausted, it starts appending letters and running through each set from
<code>_aa</code> to <code>_az</code>, <code>_ba</code> to <code>_bz</code>,
etc.  The code is written such that it will expand the names further if
needed but it is more likely that the script will have fewer unique
variables than the number of unique new names that can be generated by the
compressor.</p>

<p>As each new name is created, a check is made to ensure that it does not
already exist in the script.  For example, common loop variable names such
as <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> will cause it to skip those new names
if they are used in the script already.  Likewise, if the new name is
longer than the existing name, it will not be replaced.  However, as noted,
you could remove that check in order to completely obfuscate the names if
necessary.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>On average, my own scripts have been reduced in size by 50% to 60%.
Adding in variable name compression increases the savings by an additional
10% to 15% in the average script.  Naturally, the more you comment your
JavaScript code, use indentation to make the code more readable, and use
descriptive variable names, the better the compression rates as there is
more stuff to remove. Using semi-colons to mark statement endpoints can
also increase the compression rates as it enables the code to remove most
if not all of the line feed characters too.</p>
